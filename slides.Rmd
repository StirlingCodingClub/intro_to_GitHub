## Code of Conduct {.smaller}

Stirling Study Group events are community events intended for networking and collaboration as well as learning. We value the participation of every member of the scientific community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout Stirling Study Group events, and in all interactions online associated with Stirling Study Group.

To make clear what is expected, everyone taking part in Stirling Study Group events and discussions --instructors, helpers, organisers, and learners -- is required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout events, but you may also contact us privately; all communication will be treated as confidential.

**Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.**

- Largest community of coders (28+ million)
- Largest [collection](https://github.com/search) of repositories (95+ million)
- Built from git [version control](https://ourcodingclub.github.io/2017/02/27/git.html)
